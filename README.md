# Monte-Carlo-Option-Pricing
 This notebook explain the pricing of options using the Monte Carlo Simulation method. Initially, we cover the background and relevant equations for the process, followed by the implementation of the method in Python. Specifically, we calculate the price of a European call option via Monte Carlo simulation and compare these results with the solution provided by the Black-Scholes formula.
